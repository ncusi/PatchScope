# PatchScope – A Modular Tool for Annotating and Analyzing Contributions

Annotates files and lines of diffs (patches) with their purpose and type,
and performs statistical analysis on the generated annotation data.

> _Note:_ this project was called 'python-diff-annotator' earlier in its history instead of 'PatchScope',
> and the python package was called 'diffannotator' instead of being called 'patchscope',
> so there are some references to that older name, for example in directory names
> in some Jupyter Notebooks.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install patchscope.

To avoid dependency conflicts, it is strongly recommended to create
a [virtual environment][venv] first, activate it, and install patchscope
into this environment.  See also "_[Virtual environment](#virtual-environment)_"
subsection below.

To install the most recent version, use
```commandline
python -m pip install patchscope@git+https://github.com/ncusi/PatchScope#egg=main
```
or (assuming that you can clone the repository with SSH)
```commandline
python -m pip install patchscope@git+ssh://git@github.com/ncusi/PatchScope.git#egg=main
```

## Usage

![Overview of tool components](./images/PatchScope%20diagram%20freehand%20-%20white%20background.png)

This tool integrates four key components
1. extracting patches from version control system or user-provided folders<br>
   as separate step with `diff-generate`, or integrated into annotation step: `diff-annotate`
2. applying specified annotation rules for selected patches<br>
   using `diff-annotate`, which generates one JSON data file per patch
3. generating configurable reports or summaries<br>
   with various subcommands of `diff-gather-stats`; each summary is saved as a single JSON file
4. advanced visualization with a web application (dashboard)<br>
   which you can run it with `panel serve`, see the description below

### Running scripts

This package installs scripts (currently three) that you can run
to generate patches, annotate them, and extract their statistics.
Every script name starts with the `diff-*` prefix.

Each script and subcommand supports the `--help` option.

- `diff-generate`: used to generate patches (*.patch and *.diff files)
  from a given repository, in the format suitable for later analysis;
  not strictly necessary;

  <u>Usage:</u> `diff-generate [OPTIONS] REPO_PATH [REVISION_RANGE...]`<br>
  (where `REVISION_RANGE...` is passed as arguments to the `git log` command)

- `diff-annotate`: annotates existing dataset (patch files in subdirectories),
  or annotates selected subset of commits (of changes in commits)
  in the given repository;

  <u>Usage:</u> `diff-annotate [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...`

    - `diff-annotate patch [OPTIONS] PATCH_FILE RESULT_JSON`:
      annotate a single PATCH_FILE, writing results to RESULT_JSON,
    - `diff-annotate dataset [OPTIONS] DATASETS...`:
      annotate all bugs in provided DATASETS,
    - `diff-anotate from-repo [OPTIONS] REPO_PATH [REVISION_RANGE...]`:
      create annotation data for commits from local Git repository
      (with `REVISION_RANGE...` passed as arguments to the `git log` command);

- `diff-gather-stats`: compute various statistics and metrics
  from patch annotation data generated by the `diff-annotate` script;

  <u>Usage:</u> `diff-gather-stats [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...`

    - `diff-gather-stats purpose-counter [--output JSON_FILE] DATASETS...`:
      calculate count of purposes from all bugs in provided datasets,
    - `diff-gather-stats purpose-per-file [OPTIONS] RESULT_JSON DATASETS...`:
      calculate per-file count of purposes from all bugs in provided datasets,
    - `diff-gather-stats lines-stats [OPTIONS] OUTPUT_FILE DATASETS...`:
      calculate per-bug and per-file count of line types in provided datasets,
    - `diff-gather-stats timeline [OPTIONS] OUTPUT_FILE DATASETS...`:
      calculate timeline of bugs with per-bug count of different types of lines;

- ...

### Running web app (dashboard)

This package also includes web dashboard, created using the [Panel][]
framework.  You would need to install additional dependencies, for
example with `pip install --editable .[web]` (if you are running this
project in editable mode).

Currently, it includes two web apps, namely Contributors Graph and Author Statistics.
You can run each app with [`panel serve`](https://panel.holoviz.org/how_to/server/commandline.html):
- `panel serve src/diffinsights_web/apps/contributors.py`
- `panel serve src/diffinsights_web/apps/author.py`

By default, it would make those apps available
at <http://localhost:5006/contributors> and <http://localhost:5006/author>, respectively.

You can also run both of them at once with
- `panel serve src/diffinsights_web/apps/*.py`

See the basic [demo on Heroku](https://patchscope-9d05e7f15fec.herokuapp.com/):
- <img height="20" src="favicon.png" width="20" />&nbsp;[Contributors Graph app](https://patchscope-9d05e7f15fec.herokuapp.com/contributors)
- <img height="20" src="favicon-author.png" width="20" />&nbsp;[Author Statistics app](https://patchscope-9d05e7f15fec.herokuapp.com/author)

## Examples and demos

This repository also includes some examples demonstrating how this
project works, and what it can be used for.

### First time setup (for generating examples)

You can set up the environment for using this project, following
the recommended practices (described in the _"[Development](#development)"_
section of this document), by running the [`examples-init.bash`](examples-init.bash) Bash script,
and following its instructions.

Note that this script assumes that it is run on Linux, or Linux-like
system.  For other operating systems, you are probably better following
the steps described in this document manually.

This script includes the configuration section at the beginning of it;
you can change parameters to better fit your environment:
- `DVCSTORE_DIR` - directory with local dvc remote
- `PYTHON` - Python 3.x executable (before activating virtual environment)


This project uses [DVC](https://dvc.org/) (Data Version Control) tool
to track annotations and metrics data, and version this data.  It allows
to store large files and large directories outside of Git repository,
while still have them to be version controlled.  They can be stored locally,
or in the cloud.

The [`examples-init.bash`](examples-init.bash) script also configures
local DVC storage (see the next subsection).

### Data pipeline with DVC

To provide reproducibility, and to make it possible to version data files
separately from versioning the code, this project uses [DVC][] (Data Version Control)
tool for its examples.

_DVC pipelines_ are versioned using Git, and allow you to better organize projects
and reproduce complete workflows and results at will.  The pipeline is defined
in the [`dvc.yaml`](./dvc.yaml) file.

You can re-run the whole pipeline, after installing DVC, with the `dvc repro`
command.  It will run only those pipeline stages that needed it, by examining
if stage dependencies (defined in `dvc.yaml`) changed.  The results are saved
in _DVC cache_, and you can push them to _DVC remote_ with `dvc push`, if you have
one configured (the `examples-init.bash` script from previous subsection
configures DVC remote with storage on the local filesystem).

<!-- TODO: add figure about how DVC works -->

> In the future the example data for demos will be available also as DVC remote,
> perhaps on [DAGsHub][], to be downloaded and used without the need to recompute it.

[DAGsHub]: https://dagshub.com/ "DagsHub: A Single Source of Truth for your AI Projects"

### Jupyter Notebooks

The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter Notebooks with data exploration,
data analysis, etc.  See [`notebooks/README.md`](./notebooks/README.md)
for details.

## Development

### Virtual environment

To avoid dependency conflicts, it is strongly recommended to create
a [virtual environment][venv], for example with:
```commandline
python -m venv .venv
```

This needs to be done only once, from top directory of the project.
For each session, you should activate the environment:
```commandline
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Using virtual environment, either directly like shown above, or
by using `pipx`, might be required if you cannot install system
packages, but Python is configured in a very specific way:

> error: externally-managed-environment
>
> × This environment is externally managed

[venv]: https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/library/venv.html

### Installing the package in editable mode

To install the project in editable mode (from top directory of this repo):
```commandline
python -m pip install -e .
```

To be able to also run test, use:
```commandline
python -m pip install --editable .[dev]
```

### Running tests

This project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) framework.
Note that `pytest` requires Python 3.8+ or PyPy3.

To run tests, run the following command
```commandline
pytest
```
or
```commandline
python -m pytest
```

Web applications that demonstrate some MSR tool:

- GitHub offers GitHub Insights for repositories
  (see for example [Contributors to qtile/qtile](https://github.com/qtile/qtile/graphs/contributors)).
  This includes the following subpages:
    - _**Pulse**_ (with configurable period of 1 month, 1 week, 3 days, 24 hours)
      shows information about pull requests and issues, and summary of changes as text
      (_N_ authors pushed _X_ commits to master, and _Y_ to all branches.
      On master, _M_ files were changed ad there had been _A_ additions and _D_ deletions).
    - _**Contributions**_ per week to master, excluding merge commits
      {as smoothed (!) line/area plot}, for whole project,
      and for up to 100 authors (with configurable period of all, last month, last 3 months,
      last 6 months, last 12 months, last 24 months; with configurable type of contributions:
      commits, additions, deletions).  For each author we also have summary of their
      contributions as text (_N_ commits, _A_ ++, _D_ --).
    - _**Commits**_ shows two plots: bar plot of commits per week over time
      for the last year {without any explanation, except for information shown on mouse hover},
      and line plot with days of the week on x-axis {no explanation, no information on hover (!)}.
      No configuration.
    - _**Code frequency**_ over the history of the project: additions and deletions per week
      (where additions use green solid lines, and deletions use red dashed lines and are plotted
      upside-down).  No configuration.
    - other pages related to GitHub specifically, or the project as whole but not its history
      (like _Community Standards_, _Dependency graph_, _Forks_, or _Action Usage Metrics_).
- GitHub also offers Developer Overview, which among others include the following chart:
    - _N_ contributions in last year / in YYYY, showing _**heatmap**_ using 5-color discrete colormap,
      with year worth of weeks on x-axis, and day of the week (Sun to Sat) on the y-axis.
      You can switch between the years with a "radio button" (though there is no 'last year' entry).
      Contributions are timestamped according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
      rather than contributor's local time zone.
- [Assayo](https://github.com/bakhirev/assayo) has a
  [homepage with demo](https://assayo.online/) where you can
